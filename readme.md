# Mongoose Queries Exercise

## Setup instructions

* Clone this repo
* `cd` to the directory you cloned it into and run `npm install`
* Make sure `mongod` is running
* Run `node db/seed.js` to populate your database with the sample exercise data
  * You should see something like this in your terminal:
  > emptied, creating data now
  > 
  > created author: Heinlein
  > 
  > created author: Rowling
  > 
  > created author: Jordan
  * Hit ctrl-c to back out of the script

## Writing actual code

Once you're all set up with seed data, open `index.js` and read through the prompts!

To check if your code worked, run `node index.js` from inside this project directory to execute it. You will have to `ctrl-c` out of it every time to run it again.
